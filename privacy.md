## About Station1
Station1 is a nonprofit organization that is building a foundation for the university of the future - a model of higher education based on inclusion and equity, learning through frontier project-based inquiry and research, and the integration of science and technology with humanistic studies for social good.

## Station1 and Facebook
Station1 will utilize Facebook to collect public data on companies that are potential candidates for partnering and hosting Station1 students as summer interns. Station1 plans on using *only public data*, such as company page posts.

## Data Informed Company Partnerships (DICP) Project
The "Data Informed Company Partnerships" project utilizes public information to make sure private/public companies goals and mission align with Station1. The DICP project gathers a company's public posts via a python script. The (text based) data acquired from Facebook will be accessible in a secured/private application, along with other public data source, for professors and staff of Station1 to review.

The Facebook data acquired will be used as a tool to gadge the companies "worthiness". E.g. does their mission and content in their posts align with Station1?

The Facebook data acquired will not be used outside of the projects goals.

The Facebook data will not be used for marketing.

The Facebook data acquired will not be sold to third parties.
